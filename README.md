## Pet Management System

This is a Java console application that allows users to manage a collection of pets through a simple, text-based interface. The system lets users add, view, search, and remove pets, supporting different species such as dogs, cats, parrots, and rabbits.

The project was built to showcase clean code structure and effective use of inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism in Java. It also demonstrates basic user interaction using the `Scanner` class and includes input validation to ensure smooth and error-resistant operation.
